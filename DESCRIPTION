Description: This package facilitates the discovery of biomarkers from
    biological sequencing data (e.g., microarrays, RNA-seq) based on the
    associations of potential biomarkers with exposure and outcome variables by
    implementing an estimation procedure that combines a generalization of
    moderated statistics with targeted minimum loss-based estimates (TMLE) of
    parameters defined via causal inference (e.g., Average Treatment Effect)
    whose estimators admit asymptotically linear representations.
